# My Programming Learning Journey

*Last Updated: 2025-04-15*

## Introduction & Motivation

I've been learning to code on and off for about 8 years. While I've picked up various skills, I want to build a more rigorous foundation and truly hone my craft. This repository will track my progress as I work through a curated list of books and courses, focusing on fundamentals and systematic design.

My goal is to move from simply *writing code* to consciously *designing programs* and understanding the deeper principles of computation and software architecture.

**Journey Started:** 2025-04-15

## Phase 1: Foundational Program Design (HtDP)

The starting point is building a strong foundation in systematic program design, focusing on the relationship between data structure and program structure.

*   **Core Text:** **_How to Design Programs, Second Edition_ (HtDP)** by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi.
    *   *Focus:* The Design Recipe, structural recursion, generative recursion, functional problem-solving.
    *   *Goal:* Master the systematic design of functions based on data definitions.

*   **Directly Related Courses/Implementations (HtDP Philosophy):**
    *   UBCx: How to Code - Simple Data & Complex Data (EdX Courses by Gregor Kiczales) - [Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x), [Complex Data Link Needed]
    *   Marco Morazan's Animated Program Design (YouTube Playlist) - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw454N-VXALSIzIe_eL5U8L4S68v2X_ak)
    *   Systematic Program Design (Coursera - Deprecated? Check link validity) - [Link](https://www.coursera.org/course/programdesign)

*   **Alternative/Comparative Foundational Texts:** *(Resources often compared to HtDP, exploring similar foundational concepts)*
    *   _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ (SICP) by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman
    *   _Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming_ (CTMCP) by Van Roy and Haridi
    *   _Concrete Abstractions: An Introduction to Computer Science_ by Hailperin, Kaiser, and Knight
    *   Paradigms of Computer Programming – Fundamentals (EdX course by Van Roy) - [Link](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/universite-catholique-de-louvain-paradigms-of-computer-programming-fundamentals)

## Phase 2: Deepening Functional & Data-Oriented Programming

Building directly on HtDP, this phase focuses on more advanced functional techniques, data structures, corecursion (generating data structures), and Test-Driven Development (TDD). This addresses critiques about HtDP's scope being primarily function-level.

*   **Key Concepts:** Functional data structures, laziness, corecursion, TDD principles.

*   **Resources:**
    *   _Purely Functional Data Structures_ by Chris Okasaki *(Seminal work on designing immutable data structures)*
    *   _Programming in Haskell_ by Graham Hutton *(Concise Haskell intro, good for seeing laziness/corecursion)*
    *   _Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!_ by Miran Lipovača *(Approachable Haskell intro)*
    *   _Functional Programming in Scala_ by Chiusano and Bjarnason *(Rigorous FP concepts)*
    *   A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing (Bootstrap World) - [Link](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/index.html) *(Alternative introductory approach with strong data focus)*
    *   Explore Test-Driven Development resources (specific books/tutorials TBD based on language choice).
    *   LiSP (Lisp in Small Pieces)
    *   PAIP (Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming) https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp
    *   Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming 
    *   Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation

## Phase 3: Understanding the Machine

Moving down the abstraction ladder to understand how programs execute and interact with hardware. This addresses the gap between high-level code and the underlying system.

*   **Key Concepts:** Computer architecture (CPU, memory hierarchy), instruction sets, operating system concepts, concurrency models.

*   **Resources - Computer Architecture:**
    *   **Books:**
        *   _"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"_ by Charles Petzold *(Conceptual Introduction)*
        *   _"Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface"_ by Patterson and Hennessy *(Standard Textbook)*
        *   _"Structured Computer Organization"_ by Andrew S. Tanenbaum *(Classic Textbook)*
    *   **Courses:**
        *   Nand to Tetris ("Build a Modern Computer from First Principles") - [Coursera Link] / [Website Link] *(Highly Recommended Project-Based Course)*
        *   Relevant university courses (e.g., via Coursera, edX, MIT OCW).

*   **Resources - Concurrency:** *(Understanding how multiple computations happen)*
    *   **Books:**
        *   _Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks_ by Paul Butcher
        *   Language-specific books (e.g., _Java Concurrency in Practice_ by Goetz et al.)

## Phase 4: Software Architecture & Large-Scale Design

Addressing the critique that HtDP focuses on functions, not programs/systems. Learning how to structure larger codebases, manage dependencies, and apply common design patterns.

*   **Key Concepts:** Modularity, abstraction, SOLID principles, architectural patterns (Layered, Microservices, etc.), design patterns, API design, refactoring.

*   **Resources:**
    *   **Books:**
        *   _"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"_ by Robert C. Martin *(Code-level maintainability)*
        *   _"Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design"_ by Robert C. Martin *(System-level structure)*
        *   _"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"_ by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides (GoF) *(Classic Pattern Catalog)*
        *   _"Head First Design Patterns"_ by Freeman, Robson, et al. *(Accessible Pattern Introduction)*
        *   _"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"_ by Martin Fowler *(Techniques for improving code structure)*
    *   **Explore:** Well-structured open-source projects.

## Phase 5: Exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Learning the dominant paradigm in many industries, understanding its strengths, weaknesses, and patterns.

*   **Key Concepts:** Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, object lifecycle, common OOP design patterns.

*   **Resources:**
    *   **Books:**
        *   _Effective Java_ by Joshua Bloch *(Practical advice for Java OOP)*
        *   _Head First Design Patterns_ by Freeman, Robson, et al. *(Revisiting patterns with an OOP lens)*
        *   _(Optional)_ _Java Precisely_ by Peter Sestoft *(If Java foundation is weak)*

## Phase 6: Continuous Learning & Software Craftsmanship

Beyond specific paradigms or technologies, focusing on the broader aspects of being an effective and thoughtful programmer.

*   **Key Concepts:** Teamwork, communication, estimation, debugging, tool mastery, pragmatic approaches.

*   **Resources:**
    *   _The Pragmatic Programmer_ by Hunt and Thomas
    *   _The Psychology of Computer Programming_ by Gerald M. Weinberg
    *   _Extreme Programming Explained_ by Kent Beck
    *   _Pair Programming Illuminated_ by Williams and Kessler
