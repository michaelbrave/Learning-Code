I have been on again off again learning to code the last 8 years. But I want to hone my craft some more, so I'm going to work through a few books and try to upgrade my skills. I will be publishing them here. 

I am going to start from fundamentals and first principles as much as I can, so I've decided to start with the book "How to Design Programs". I've started working through this book in the past but I will succed in finishing this time.
