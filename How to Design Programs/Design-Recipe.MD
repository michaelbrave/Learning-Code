1. From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions
    - Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming language, Formulate data definitions and illustrate them with examples.
2. Signature, Purpose Statement, Header
    - State what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question what the function computes. Define a stub that lives up to the signature. 
3. Functional Examples
    - Work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose
4. Function Definition
    - Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.
5. Function Definition
    - Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples. 
6. Testing
    - Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples in that they help others read and undestand the definition when the need arises - and it will arise for any serious program. 

or more simplified
1. analyze a problem statement, typically stated as a word problem;
2. extract and express its essence, abstractly;
3. illustrate the essence with examples;
4. make outlines and plans based on this analysis;
5. evaluate results with respect to expected outcomes; and
6. revise the product in light of failed checks and tests.
